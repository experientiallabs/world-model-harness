"""Leak-free demo retrieval shared by GEPA optimization and replay evaluation.

Both replay-style evaluations (`wmh.engine.replay`) and GEPA's held-out scoring
(`wmh.optimize.gepa`) must retrieve the demos the serving world model would use, WITHOUT letting a
held-out step see its own answer. The rule is identical in both places, so it lives here once:

  - retrieve only from a TRAIN corpus (never the held-out/val steps);
  - never return a demo from the query step's OWN trace (which would surface the very observation we
    are asking the model to predict, or an adjacent step that gives it away).

Implementation note: same-trace exclusion keys on object identity (`id`). That is correct here
because the corpus `Step`s flow straight from `retriever.index(corpus)` into `retriever.topk(...)`
in-process — the exact same objects. Do NOT build a `DemoRetriever` over a retriever that was
reloaded from disk (`EmbeddingRetriever.load`), as that reconstructs fresh `Step`s whose identities
won't match the corpus and the exclusion would silently no-op.
