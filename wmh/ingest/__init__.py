"""Trace ingestion: file uploads and vendor pulls -> normalized `Trace` objects.

A `TraceAdapter` turns one source's telemetry into the generic `Trace` schema. Adapters register
themselves on import and are looked up by name (`get_adapter`) or listed (`list_adapters`). The
span-based adapters share one normalizer (`wmh.ingest.normalize`) and the `BaseTraceAdapter`
scaffolding, so adding a new source is transport + attribute-mapping, not a rewrite. See
`docs/ingest.md`.

Bundled adapters:
  - `otel-genai`  : OTLP-JSON spans following the OTel GenAI semantic conventions (file or pull).
  - `chat-json`   : recorded OpenAI-style chat/tool-call conversations (file).
Provider adapters (Braintrust, Phoenix/Arize, Langfuse, LangSmith) register when their module is
imported; their heavy SDKs are optional extras, imported lazily inside the adapter.
