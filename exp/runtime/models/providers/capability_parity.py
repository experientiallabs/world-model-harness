"""Machine-readable per-deployment capability parity for catalog consumers.

The platform catalog declares gateway capabilities per deployment and the
engine holds the provider-family ground truth (effort ladders, thinking-config
generations). This module joins the two into one versioned row so a catalog
can pre-warn on gaps (a synced row that declares no ``strict_tools`` anywhere
in an alias's waterfall) and route around them before a caller hits the
fail-closed 400.
